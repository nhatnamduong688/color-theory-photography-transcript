1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,480
hey everybody welcome back once again to

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,560
another episode of The Art of

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,200
Photography my name is Ted Forbes and

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,520
today we're going to talk about color

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,000
theory a little bit and I want to talk

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,360
about uh the deliberate use of composing

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,320
using color in photographs and I know

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,960
that might sound obvious to some people

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,119
it might sound weird to others uh but I

10
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,160
want to look at this today and we're

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,000
going to look at some images that work

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,279
really well I want to go over to

13
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,439
Pinterest and look at some stuff I've

14
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,640
collected and show you guys where that

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,599
is if you want to study further um and I

16
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,039
want to talk about color in photography

17
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,519
now I know this is a weird way to start

18
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,840
this but I want to start it by talking

19
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,199
about black and white and personally if

20
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,360
you guys are familiar with my work I

21
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,760
shoot a lot in black and white that's

22
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,480
just my taste it's you know what I like

23
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,520
to do and people will ask me from time

24
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,000
to time why do you only work in black

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,399
and white well I don't only work in

26
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,680
black and white just the majority of my

27
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,399
work is in that um but the answer you

28
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,800
know I had to think about it and and

29
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,960
it's this to me it's that when you know

30
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,079
and I think it's this way to a lot of

31
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,559
photographers for that matter but when

32
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,840
you work in black and white you're

33
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
removing all the color information to a

34
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,320
photograph and this goes for any kind of

35
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,480
monochrome situation so like a cyanotype

36
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,960
even or if you're even if you're toning

37
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,719
or staining you're removing

38
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,760
the RGB color data from the the scene

39
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,200
that you're shooting or your picture and

40
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,159
that removes it from reality one two

41
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,040
levels you know and so obviously you're

42
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,000
not dealing with it you're dealing with

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,560
this tonal scale that becomes part of

44
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,360
the composition the light there's more

45
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
emphasis on what the light is doing and

46
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,479
you know these are just reasons I

47
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,159
personally like black and white photos I

48
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,960
like to look at them I like to make them

49
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,759
myself um now I also like to work in

50
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,759
color somewhat um and for me because

51
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,520
that black and white is that you know

52
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,399
removing that dimension of what reality

53
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,600
is or what you see dayto day the most

54
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,560
successful color work and the guys that

55
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,799
I look up to that that shoot amazing

56
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,360
stuff there's always or there's

57
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,159
generally well I would say there's

58
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,240
always this deliberate attempt when it's

59
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,600
successful where that color is a

60
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
successful part in the composition it's

61
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,000
integral to making it work it's not

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,479
dependent on the color but the color

63
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,640
really works to bring it all together

64
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,600
and I think this can work in one of two

65
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
ways uh you could be outshooting uh kind

66
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,640
of street style improvisational type

67
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,799
photography and you know you might see a

68
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,560
solid color wall so you can kind of

69
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
limit the colors in it maybe it's a nice

70
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,520
contrast or a complimentary color to you

71
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,840
know what somebody might be wearing you

72
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,599
frame up and you're able to get the shot

73
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,680
and a lot of the great work we're going

74
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,400
to look at today is done that way um

75
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,599
there's also deliberately planning a

76
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,680
composition in a studio type situation

77
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,280
or location shoot where you have that

78
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,720
control and if you can learn to kind of

79
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,519
plan this color stuff into it I think

80
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,040
you're going to get much more successful

81
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
photographs it's hard to do we don't

82
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,080
always do it well but um you know that

83
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
conscious effort is really important so

84
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,160
I want to talk about color theory a

85
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,920
little bit today before we get you know

86
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
too much into it and then we're going to

87
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,959
go over to Pinterest and look at some

88
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,120
images I've collected I'll give you the

89
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,879
URL so you can you can check that out on

90
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,200
your own too so come on over and let's

91
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,080
have a look okay so we're going to talk

92
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,440
about color theory here for a second and

93
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,000
uh I'm going to use a website to

94
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,920
illustrate this and this is a wonderful

95
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,440
website I used to use this when I taught

96
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,360
my college course and uh it it it's

97
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,239
really cool students are very receptive

98
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,000
to it it's a very visual way of learning

99
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,879
all the concepts we're going to talk

100
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,519
talk about here this website is

101
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,040
maintained by Adobe and it's called

102
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,440
Adobe I presume it's pronounced color

103
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
but it's spelled k l r so Adobe color

104
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,560
and uh the URL on that is kle r.

105
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,200
adobe.com there's also an iPhone app um

106
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,599
is free to use you do not have to be a

107
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,959
member of the Creative Suite to do this

108
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,799
um however if you do sign in and I

109
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,080
believe the account on this is free you

110
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,760
can sync some stuff up between the app

111
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,319
and the website and you can save color

112
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,519
combinations and Etc but anyway I want

113
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,080
to talk about what we're looking at here

114
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,239
and what you see in the middle here is

115
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,400
just a basic color wheel now the way

116
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,720
Color Works is you know color comes from

117
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,159
a in in in terms of the light source um

118
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
you have colors of red green and blue or

119
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,000
RGB that's the the light spectrum of

120
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,480
colors so it's the RGB color spectrum

121
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,959
and that's how we see things you've

122
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,599
heard the term RGB because that's how

123
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,920
your monitor works that's how it's

124
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,439
calibrated that's how your digital

125
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,879
camera Works um and so we're working in

126
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,159
an RGB color space and if we look on

127
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
here we have a color wheel and you know

128
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,879
you see these primary colors when

129
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,760
becomes the most red or the most blue or

130
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,319
the most green and combinations of these

131
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,120
colors uh end up making secondary and

132
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,920
tertiary colors so for instance

133
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,640
everybody pretty much knows that if you

134
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,760
mix blue and red together you start to

135
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,480
get purple or lavenders you can see down

136
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,239
in here and what we have here are a

137
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,919
series of little you know switches you

138
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,759
can toggle here and if I click and drag

139
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,080
these they stay well for the most part

140
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,639
the we have an analogous um color

141
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,479
combination which basically means we

142
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,680
have our primary here which is red and

143
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
when I move these points on the sides

144
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,160
they're going to stay analogous in that

145
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,280
they're going to be the same distance

146
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,560
from that red so you can see when I move

147
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,000
this orange towards yellow you can see

148
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,320
the bottom one down here starts moving

149
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,160
towards blue and we come up with this

150
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,520
combination of five colors down here so

151
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,400
what we're looking at is an analogous

152
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,639
color scheme here and also note that if

153
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,479
I drag the middle one down this red look

154
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,160
what happens to the colors below I start

155
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,880
to wash them out and they become you

156
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,680
know less saturated much lighter and so

157
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,600
saturation and value are kind of two

158
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
different things but you know you can

159
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,479
have a softer red or a harder red

160
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:04,840
depending on you know what you're mixing

161
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,919
it with and this is how color all Blends

162
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,400
together and if I spin this wheel around

163
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
I start to see various color

164
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,840
combinations that are indeed what we're

165
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
calling analogous and this is how these

166
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
colors are related to one another so

167
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
that's what we're defining here so if I

168
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
change my color rule to something like

169
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
monochromatic you can see that they all

170
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,600
stay in various values of one color and

171
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,560
so we think you know I earlier referred

172
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
to monochromatic as black and white well

173
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,160
that's just shades of black to white and

174
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,759
right here we're looking at shades of

175
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,600
red or if I start to move this dial

176
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
around we're looking at shades of purple

177
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,759
or shades of blue I can go over to

178
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,960
yellow or green or somewhere in between

179
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,639
you can obviously adjust the saturation

180
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,759
as well and our scheme here is locked

181
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,199
into one that is indeed monochromatic is

182
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,360
what we're calling that because it just

183
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,199
deals with one color at a time so that's

184
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,759
another color scheme if we look at these

185
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,199
these are just various ways of grouping

186
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,319
colors um that have relationships to

187
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,880
each other so the Triad scheme is a

188
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,800
little bit different because we're

189
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
taking three colors

190
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,919
um that are pretty much at you know if

191
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,560
you divide the color spectrum by thirds

192
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
that's where they sit uh you can go

193
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,319
through and play with all these

194
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,840
complimentary colors are opposites on

195
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,599
the color wheel and so generally they

196
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,199
have a lot of contrast to the eye

197
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,199
between them so if I take this red over

198
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,960
here and we we'll look at this an

199
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,880
example in a minute its complimentary

200
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,240
color relationship is to Green on the

201
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,120
other side of the color wheel so that's

202
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,759
what complimentary means is these two

203
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,280
colors complement each other because

204
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
they are opposite on the color wheel and

205
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,759
you you can go in you can do compound

206
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,720
Shades or you can do custom combinations

207
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
as well but mainly these top ones all

208
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
but the custom category these are ways

209
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
of looking at colors in ways that they

210
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,039
relate to each other um doesn't

211
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,400
necessarily mean they're always pleasing

212
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
to the eye but they can be because

213
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,759
there's a continuity there's a

214
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,160
relationship and there's you know um

215
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,520
there's a definition of how these colors

216
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,120
relate to each other so that's how that

217
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,400
works so go check that out that's color.

218
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,080
adobe.com kle r. adobe.com you can

219
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,560
download the app and check it out

220
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,360
incidentally if you are a designer this

221
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,759
is a wonderful tool because it does give

222
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,400
you hexadecimal values RGB values Etc so

223
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,360
you can save color combinations that you

224
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,960
like that you might be working for for a

225
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,560
client or something like that but um and

226
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
for photography I think it it is

227
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,639
interesting too there also is a way in

228
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,199
here where you can upload photos and

229
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,800
Sample colors out of the photos which is

230
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,319
pretty interesting too but now what I

231
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,400
want to do is I want to switch over and

232
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,759
let's talk about relationships of colors

233
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,560
in photography in a way that's very

234
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
successful so I'm going to go over to my

235
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,360
Pinterest account here and one thing I

236
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,919
want to show you guys cuz I do refer to

237
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
the Pinterest account quite a bit cuz we

238
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,720
keep collections in here um I'm going to

239
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
go over to my boards so if you want to

240
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,080
follow me on Pinterest it's

241
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,919
Pinterest.com Ted Forbes that's TEF R

242
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,240
bees I'll put a link in the show notes

243
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,400
and Pinterest has a way of doing pens

244
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,120
which I'm clipping from the internet and

245
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,919
arranging them in what they call boards

246
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,000
which are collections Now by default the

247
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,479
way the boards work and we've used these

248
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,520
on the show before you've seen them uh

249
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
the newest boards are always at the

250
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,280
bottom of this list so we're going to

251
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,599
scroll to the bottom and I have one on

252
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,520
color theory that I'm going to look at

253
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,960
here and I have three photographers here

254
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,199
um there are way more than this but I

255
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,360
think these are some guys that are

256
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,080
particularly interesting to me in the

257
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,879
way they used color I'm going to take

258
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,440
these a little out of order here this is

259
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,039
a very famous image this is the red

260
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,960
ceiling from Green Greenwood Mississippi

261
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,039
um 1974 from the wonderful controversial

262
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,720
William Egleston not everyone loves

263
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,639
William eglon I understand um I have

264
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,879
kind of a LoveHate with him myself but

265
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,319
you know these days it's more love than

266
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,159
hate so I'm showing him and I think this

267
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,240
is an important photograph to show and

268
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,159
you have to remember at the time too

269
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:33,080
that egon's career was beginning color

270
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,760
photography was not considered fine art

271
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,159
at all and eglon comes around and does a

272
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
you know series of major exhibitions at

273
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,919
you know Museum of Modern Art New York

274
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
Etc and all of a sudden he's the

275
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,040
photographer kind of breaks in and all

276
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,279
of a sudden color becomes accepted um as

277
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,920
an artistic medium in contemporary

278
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,360
photography and his images are a little

279
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,080
rough and they're a little raw you much

280
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,399
in the same way somebody like Robert

281
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,640
Frank kind of is when you compare him to

282
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,720
Cartier brel for instance um if you

283
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,519
compare eglon to other contempories of

284
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
his it's rough it's raw it's weird it

285
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,640
doesn't always work there's a there's a

286
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,040
tension that comes with it anyway this

287
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,320
is a very famous image that was taken in

288
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,240
Mississippi of this red ceiling and you

289
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,880
know what makes this work and what makes

290
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,600
you remember it and what makes it stand

291
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,160
out um despite the odd poster on the

292
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,200
back with the um you know various

293
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,120
positions being explained but anyway

294
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,160
side note um is the fact that this is

295
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,959
very monochromatic um remember

296
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,519
monochromatic were shades of the same

297
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,920
color well what you're seeing here are

298
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,480
shades of red um some are dark some are

299
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,320
light that's what you know defines the

300
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,079
depth what you see the three three

301
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,120
dimensions of the room in and it works

302
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,880
on that scale of being monochromatic um

303
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
you know which is very interesting uh

304
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,200
eglon also in a more accessible way did

305
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,399
some other photos there's another one

306
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,480
that I've shown on the show before um

307
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
that I love these these two women

308
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,399
smoking at a diner and what makes this

309
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,200
successful and what makes it work is

310
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
because you can isolate this down to

311
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,839
colors that stand out now obviously a

312
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,760
lot of these guys were shooting I don't

313
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,839
know for sure but what this was shot on

314
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,480
but I assume it was Kodak Chrome which

315
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,600
had you know at that time technology was

316
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,839
trying to catch up in the film world and

317
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,680
kodor had a very specific look to it and

318
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,959
it's very beautiful and it's very

319
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,519
workable with these types of images and

320
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,320
you know the main colors that stand out

321
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,959
are the green and the red you know the

322
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,440
red on the menu you know these seat

323
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
cushions are green and then you have

324
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
some you know secondary colors the skin

325
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
tones the pink dress but really the ones

326
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
that catch your eye are the red and the

327
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
green and the red is also pretty much

328
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,519
echoed in the brick on the wall ball

329
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,800
back there and those are the things that

330
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,320
stand out so if you take a quick Glimpse

331
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,200
at this photo your eye catches those

332
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,480
really quickly and those are remember

333
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
what we called complimentary colors

334
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,399
because they are opposites on that color

335
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,360
wheel the red and the green and so this

336
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,760
is an interesting photograph there's a

337
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,639
little bit of tension uh it's an awkward

338
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,000
pose it's the back of this woman's head

339
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,399
it's kind of neat too um in a kind of a

340
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,360
nostalgic sense and anyway that's one of

341
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,800
the things that makes that photo work

342
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,959
very well um another guy that I've shown

343
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,880
on the show before that I can never get

344
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,839
enough of personally is the wonderful

345
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,160
saw leader by the way there is a

346
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,200
documentary that is I don't know if it's

347
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,160
out yet I think it is on Saul leader

348
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
I'll have to look that up and and

349
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,399
discuss it on the show as well but Saul

350
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,440
was an early colorist as well um he

351
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,720
wasn't discovered really until the 1990s

352
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,639
he was a professional photographer did a

353
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,839
lot of fashion magazine work most of

354
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
that was black and white at the time and

355
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519
he shot these color photos just his

356
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,880
personal projects for his own Amusement

357
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,560
fun personal gratification practice

358
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,360
whatever you want to call it and they

359
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,959
were kind of discovered in boxes in the

360
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,440
9s of course all still live today and

361
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,920
they're amazing they're they're

362
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,079
mind-blowing um you know if you just

363
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,880
kind of take a quick glance at this

364
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,800
photo again you see these primary colors

365
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,639
that are standing out here uh they're

366
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,600
very hard primaries but uh you are

367
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,279
seeing them as that and so you have the

368
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,880
yellow and the the red that make up the

369
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,000
taxi and then you have this orange and

370
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,240
guess what if you mix red and yellow

371
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,600
you're going to get orange so um you

372
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
could call these analogous in terms of

373
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
color and you see this a lot um Saul's

374
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,639
work also and this is not color related

375
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,200
but has um an abstract quality to it

376
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,760
there's lots of Street Scenes inv

377
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,519
variable weather conditions there's

378
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,240
definitely a style and look to it and

379
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
abstraction plays into that quite a bit

380
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,839
usually there's something in the

381
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,160
foreground that's blurred out that you

382
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,440
don't know what it is but the important

383
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,959
part is we're given enough information

384
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,560
in this image to understand that it's a

385
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,320
taxi and the color is a very Dynamic

386
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,040
part of that it doesn't Define that it's

387
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,600
a taxi it just tells you red and yellow

388
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,639
um the shapes combined with those colors

389
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,920
are what you know end up giving you the

390
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
the the um the conception of the car so

391
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,240
anyway um wonderful stuff another great

392
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,199
saw leader here um again with you know

393
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,560
the soft colors in this case you have a

394
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,399
real hard primary red down here that

395
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,199
stands out red is very sensitive or your

396
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,839
eye is very sensitive to the color red

397
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:43,040
so you don't need a lot of it um it can

398
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,839
make a wonderful accent color at times

399
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,800
you have some you know faded yellows in

400
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,440
here and then almost a faded blue light

401
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,160
in the background this woman's dress is

402
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,839
blue this really works um it works

403
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,199
wonderfully um compositionally in terms

404
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,160
of its color and and mainly too and I

405
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,279
want to point this out is because

406
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,920
there's not a lot going on in these um a

407
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,320
lot of times photography is not what you

408
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,920
put in the photo it's what you leave out

409
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,680
of the photo and that's the hard part is

410
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
getting things out of the photo so this

411
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,800
composition is not one that is going to

412
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
be a really easy one just to go to a

413
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,560
cafe and take I mean this I'm sure Saul

414
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,760
was deliberate with this um he just had

415
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,639
that kind of an eye to him and you know

416
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,399
and caught this scene it's it's a

417
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,639
beautiful picture uh a couple others

418
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,560
here again you see a lot of the same use

419
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,839
in Sals photos of the Blues Reds and and

420
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,959
yellows and again we see that here

421
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,399
interestingly enough though is this pink

422
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,760
umbrella back here is a nice little

423
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,160
accent color so sometimes you know if

424
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,839
you're going to let another color come

425
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,600
in just just a little Glimpse or a blip

426
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,920
of it has a really nice wonderful effect

427
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,240
to it at times um but anyway wonderful

428
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,199
stuff I also like how the blue is really

429
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,120
not created by any specific object it's

430
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,920
just kind of the color of the light and

431
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
being that it's overcast and cloudy a

432
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,639
lot of that has to do with you know at

433
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,959
this time what kind of film you were

434
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,320
shooting on and today's terms would

435
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,079
probably equate more to what white

436
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,000
balance you were set at um can have

437
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,519
various effects and you know that if you

438
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,800
shoot on the wrong white balance you can

439
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,600
get two blue outside but you can also

440
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,000
control that and make it just a little

441
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,480
bit blue if it works for your

442
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,399
composition so anyway some things to

443
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,000
consider um and then lastly the most one

444
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
of the more famous ones and I love this

445
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
this abstract of you know somebody

446
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,880
working on the street writing something

447
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,680
on a notepad um but it's taken from

448
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,800
behind a fogged up window and you just

449
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,759
see this yellow shape in the background

450
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,800
not sure what it is it's probably a

451
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,600
delivery truck um but you know it's not

452
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,440
clearly defined as such anyway

453
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,040
absolutely beautiful stuff saw leader is

454
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,199
one of my favorites um I also want to

455
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:37,680
talk about one other photographer today

456
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,079
who I think is an outstanding colorist

457
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,360
uh there's some other things about his

458
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
work that make it beautiful as well but

459
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,360
this is Luigi giri um that's spelled g h

460
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,720
i r r i on the last name go look him up

461
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,680
he is a wonderful Italian photographer

462
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,480
he died oh a little while ago in the

463
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,360
early 90s 1992 or so but did some

464
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,000
wonderful stuff um this first image will

465
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,199
we look at he was a kind of known for

466
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,000
his use of of Krome and Polaroid both

467
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,519
but uh you know you see a lot in those

468
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,880
images um the very simple color study um

469
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,160
and this is very indicative of his style

470
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,519
um when you start trying to count how

471
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,399
many colors you're seeing here they're

472
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,120
bounced around in the composition but

473
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,480
there aren't very many um essentially

474
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,399
you're dealing with that um you know

475
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,240
this this the blue and the uh you know

476
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,120
these jars and then you have the J

477
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,680
position of this blue lid over here

478
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,480
which is kind of interesting this is

479
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,240
probably set up to be so and then this

480
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,079
blue ceramic uh vase if you will over

481
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
here you have kind of this darker red

482
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
which shares a little bit of hue with

483
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,120
the wood on the table and this yellow

484
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,360
here and then the rest is kind of you

485
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,720
know not so much defined as being color

486
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,399
um and and notice that the saturation

487
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,880
level that Luigi used on a lot of these

488
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,440
is just very very minimal um it just has

489
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,160
I don't like the word flat because that

490
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,480
implies negativity and I don't think

491
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,560
it's a negative thing at all but they

492
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,399
are flat colors and and they're

493
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,480
beautiful they're amazing um they don't

494
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,920
have a lot of vibrancy to them but

495
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,519
that's that's the draw you know um again

496
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,800
another another Gary piece this is a

497
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,440
beach and uh what's beautiful about this

498
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,040
too as I opened the link accidentally um

499
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,839
is the colors that you get out of this

500
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,839
are these turquoise colors of how you

501
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,480
know the area here where I guess you

502
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,199
would play some kind of game or

503
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,880
something this ramp is a turquoise color

504
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,399
which matches with the ocean which is

505
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,360
not far from the blue the colors on the

506
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,199
swing set here of the um of the metal

507
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,120
and then you know in contrast to those

508
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,319
this blue and red here

509
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,440
um has it just has a nice feel to it and

510
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,839
and it's a very wonderful composition

511
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,519
and the color is a big part of his style

512
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,079
um another thing that Luigi G did a lot

513
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,920
and I'm sorry this is not a huge version

514
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,360
of this I will try and link up to a

515
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,240
bigger one by the time you look at this

516
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,399
um this is an image I'll zoom in here um

517
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,279
and this is one thing that that Luigi

518
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,319
liked to play a lot with in composition

519
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,639
was kind of this false sense reality in

520
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,160
the context of reality and what this is

521
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,079
is it's a it's a photo of a ship and the

522
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,079
page is torn and so it looks like it's

523
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,720
creeping up behind a sand dune or

524
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,079
something at first glance and then you

525
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,640
realize that it's just on a piece of

526
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,319
corkboard or something and the image is

527
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,079
actually torn but it looks like creates

528
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,640
the illusion that there's this wave

529
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,600
coming down anyway he he played a lot

530
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,079
with that kind of

531
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,120
metaphorical um it's metaphor but at the

532
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,760
same time it's also just kind of a fun

533
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,880
play um of composition between reality

534
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,559
and non-reality this is another famous

535
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,679
image of his these people that are

536
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,320
looking at a poster I assume it's some

537
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,960
kind of three-dimensional map but it you

538
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,840
know has this feel of these people

539
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,320
looking off into uh mountain range and

540
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,240
of course the mountain range is not real

541
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,360
and again look at the subdued colors of

542
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,919
the clothing um and also the limited

543
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,080
color palette and I think that's

544
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,559
important in all these it's not a ton of

545
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,240
colors and they're shapes that are

546
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
predominantly colored that work together

547
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,240
mainly the jackets these people are

548
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,840
wearing uh with the green the light blue

549
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,880
the um you know these pastel like this

550
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
yellow and then the way that echoes in

551
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,840
the poster as well so again wonderful

552
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,960
stuff um another interesting shot I love

553
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,600
that the accent color in here is this

554
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,159
yellow of this woman and I'm presuming

555
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,880
she's not looking at a real cavernous

556
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,840
Lake here she's looking at a painting or

557
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,280
it's a uh um some kind of street art

558
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,520
that's been torn up or something but

559
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,559
anyway um so you have that kind of comic

560
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,679
play going on there but also the back of

561
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,679
this woman there's that beautiful accent

562
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,720
of yellow in her dress which which you

563
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,159
know pretty much compliments the blues

564
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,320
and greens that you see above her so

565
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,880
anyway you know and I think this was all

566
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,159
conscious um you know with all these

567
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,120
photographers and this is how you end up

568
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
getting stuff that's interesting and

569
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
this is how you end up getting stuff

570
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,440
that makes sense and it you know I think

571
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,440
all three of these guys Egleston uh Gary

572
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,240
and uh sa leader all three uh you know

573
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
their use of color is a big part of

574
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,919
their style and there's two things that

575
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,679
play into that it's the relationship

576
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,720
between those colors and the simplicity

577
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,039
so there's not a lot that you're looking

578
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
at so they stick out um they have a

579
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
relationship with one another and then

580
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,000
also the fact that uh you know in in

581
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,039
terms of intensity and saturation of

582
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:12,440
these values too I think played a a part

583
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,200
in the way these guys worked look like

584
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,960
you know with leader you see kind of

585
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,520
these saturated yellows that are very

586
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,640
deep against kind of these gloomy

587
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,159
backgrounds a lot of times with a lot of

588
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,880
blacks and you know other colors uh

589
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
whereas you know aglon has a very harsh

590
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,480
approach too but on the complete other

591
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,720
end of the spectrum you have Lu Gary Who

592
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,640
does these you know Wonderful pastel

593
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,960
colored um you know kind of quirky funny

594
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,919
sometimes scenes and I think he's a very

595
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,400
very underrated photographer um and if

596
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,039
you don't know his work I will link to

597
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,559
him so go to the show notes and check it

598
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
out okay so we've talked a lot about

599
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,280
color theory today we've looked at some

600
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,200
color photographs and you know like I

601
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,240
said earlier I think that when this is

602
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,799
it's most successful they you know color

603
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,120
becomes part of a composition and color

604
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
works with your imagery um and has an

605
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,559
effect within that and I think that and

606
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,200
this may sound obvious but it's amazing

607
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,840
how hard this is to learn you know I

608
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,400
think as we evolve as photographers as

609
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
we evolve as creative people as we

610
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,480
evolve as artists most of this is

611
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,960
learning how to see and I know that

612
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,480
that's you know something you hear a lot

613
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,919
of people say it's fairly obvious you

614
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,360
know you're learning how to see I have a

615
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,880
friend of mine that a little bit older

616
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,400
than I am this was back in the film days

617
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,480
before everybody had a digital camera

618
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,000
and uh you know he was he is a very

619
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
Mentor type personality and a very good

620
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,480
friend and he's one of those guys that

621
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,159
if everybody's sitting around shoot

622
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,400
hanging out and shooting the breeze or

623
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,919
whatever somebody has a camera and he'll

624
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,240
say Hey you know check it out and then

625
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,520
he's kind of teaching everybody

626
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
something and he's a very good

627
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,960
photographer um on top of that and I

628
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,799
remember we were sitting there and and

629
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,320
with actually it was somebody it was his

630
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,840
son that was sitting there and he was

631
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,080
showing him he said you know he looked

632
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
at me he says you know most of this is

633
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,039
like you know learning how to see and

634
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,679
it's amazing that most people who are

635
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
beginning or don't have much experience

636
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,240
with the camera generally pick it up

637
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,400
look through the viewfinder they're not

638
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
actually looking at anything point the

639
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,840
thing in the general direction and voila

640
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
let's hope something comes out and

641
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,039
really good photography is always a

642
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,679
deliberate attempt to try to control all

643
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,200
those elements and learn how to see

644
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
things learn how to not only look at

645
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
something but there's an interpretation

646
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,600
element of it like you know if I see uh

647
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,279
you know a man standing on a next to a

648
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,799
park bench is that a great photo no it's

649
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,559
an interesting subject and then your

650
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,960
mind what makes you good as a

651
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,039
photographer is trying to interpret okay

652
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,440
what would make a good photo maybe I

653
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,880
wait for him to do something maybe I ask

654
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,799
him to pose maybe I change the angle

655
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:26,919
maybe the light's not right and I want

656
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,120
to recreate this later any there's a

657
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,400
million things that go into that um so

658
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,600
anyway I think color is the same way and

659
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,240
it's you know when like I said when it's

660
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,640
most successful and when it's most

661
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,559
dramatic and when it sticks out the most

662
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,880
is when it's you know one there's an

663
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,720
element of Simplicity to it and two it's

664
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
deliberately planned and I think it's

665
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
just like everything else in composition

666
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,919
um you know there's something to be said

667
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,799
for minimalist approach to things to

668
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,760
narrowing things down to just a single

669
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
tract of focus and you know no pun

670
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,799
intended and you know getting the

671
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,039
Clutter out of the way and really

672
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,600
letting elements speak for themselves

673
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,720
and then arranging them in a manner

674
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,159
that's beautiful so

675
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,760
all of it is easier said than done I

676
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,279
struggle with this all the time myself

677
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,720
so anyway I hope you found some of this

678
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,360
useful today I really hope you found

679
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,279
some of it inspiring um I love showing

680
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,960
work by people that I look up to and

681
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,240
these are always fun episodes for me to

682
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,760
do so anyway that's it for today and

683
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,480
once again everybody thank you again for

684
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,960
watching the Arts of Photography and I

685
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,039
will see you next time
